#Python Tutorial
1. Print
2. Variables
   - Python is a object oriented not statically typed.
   - Every variable in python is a object.
   - So we need not declare the variable nor their type.
2.1 Types of Variables
    1. Numbers
    2. Strings
   - Python Supports two types of numbers which are integers(Whole number) and floating point numbers(decimal)
   Syntax for integer :int = 10
   Syntax for Float : float = 5.5
   Syntax for finding the type of the object : What_type = type(object)
  - Strings are represented either in single or double qutoes
  Example : my_string = "I love India"
3. List
   - List is as similar to arrays
   - They can contain any type of variable and any number of variables.
   Example : my_list = [1,2,3]
